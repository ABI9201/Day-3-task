3.difference between window screen and document in javascript

Window screen

Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.

Document in javascript

 Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and 

modification of document content. The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM.
